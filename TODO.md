# for the future!

## menu
fix spacing
connect themes with themes
  changing the classNames of elements 
    only chaning the background color and border colors of things

## bugs
adding total sqft from the beginning doesn't change the paint amount
therefore doesn't get added to cost at the end
## features
reconsider that best way to apply each wall?

changing color theme for the user
= they'll need a pop-up menu to select options
= different color choices

clients using the app can extened it into their book keeping softeware to then upload their info

## styling
WDO selector layout
  labels and inputs are crammped(sp) 

initial inputs
  margin-left

        gallons
0 primer        0 paint
  (something like this)

Jazz up the totals
  feels bland

think about fonts
  inputs have their own compared to the app.

where can i add more color
